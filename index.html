   <h3>Biography</h3>
   <p>Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou was born on 29 March 1943 in Agria, a coastal town in Magnesia, Thessaly, Greece, and raised in Athens. His father Odysseus worked in property and was<br/> an amateur sprinter; Vangelis described him as "a great lover of music".His mother Foteini Kyriakopoulou was trained as a soprano. Vangelis had one brother, Nikos. Vangelis recalled a peaceful<br/> 
   and happy childhood without interference from his parents, who let him be involved in his activities, mainly consisting of playing the piano, painting, and constructing things with his hands.<br />
   Vangelis developed an interest in music at age four, composing on the family piano and experimenting with sounds by placing nails and kitchen pans inside it and with radio interference.When<br />
   he was six his parents enrolled him for music lessons, but was unable to take to formal tuition as he preferred to develop technique on his own.In later life he considered himself fortunate to have<br />
   not attended music school, thinking it would have impeded his creativity.He never learned to read or write music, instead played from memory: "When the teachers asked me to play something,<br /> I would pretend that I was reading it and play from memory. I didn't fool them, but I didn't care". One of his piano teachers was Greek composer Aristotelis Koundouroff.</p>
